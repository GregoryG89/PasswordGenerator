# PasswordGenerator
Generates password after prompts

I want to prompt user to input password criteria using prompt command, first one being prompting for a password between 8 - 128 special (repeat if they dont answer within the criteria)


im going to create 4 confirm questions one for each parameter of the password generator ie one of uppercase, one for lowererer case, one for num and one for special character
Create an Array housing Special chars, uppercase, Lowers case, and numbers
Create my rules using if else depending on what the user enters using Concat() to pull from multiple strings if neccesary.

Finally i want to create a for loop using length from the prompt of howLong (which was determined by the user) and have it pull from the arrays
